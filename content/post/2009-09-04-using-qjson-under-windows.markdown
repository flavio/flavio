Recently lots of people asked me how to build QJson under Windows. Most of
them reported build/link errors, so I decided to try personally.

The good news is that QJson can be successfully built under Window, I can show
you proof ;)

I have written the build instructions on QJson website: just take a look
[here](http://qjson.sourceforge.net/build).

One last note: if you have problems with QJson please subscribe to the
[developer mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/qjson-
devel) and post a message.
