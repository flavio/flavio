In these days I decided to improve the site switching from Joomla to Drupal.
I liked Joomla very much because it was really easy and immediate to use. But
there was a think I didn't like about it: the way it handled news. I wanted to
have something similar to a blog, and this isn't Joomla mission. So, after
using Drupal for [strigi's website](http://strigi.sf.net), I fall in love with
it and I decided to make _"the switch"_.

During the upgrade I also installed a _"real"_ gallery program (I'm referring
to _[Gallery](http://gallery.sourceforge.net/)_), you can navigate through it
clicking [here](/gallery).

I hope you'll like the new look and will enjoy it!

I also promise that I'll keep this site more updated, stay tuned... in the
next weeks I'll start writing some good technical post ;)

Btw, during the upgrade I ported all previous contents and comments to drupal.
