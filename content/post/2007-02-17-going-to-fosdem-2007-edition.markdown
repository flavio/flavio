This year I'll go to FOSDEM 2007 edition where I'll give a presentation
regarding Strigi. 

FOSDEM stands for _"**F**ree **O**pen **S**ource **D**evelopers **E**uropean
**M**eeting"_.

This is one of the most important happenings for the open-source scene in
Europe. It takes place in Bruxelles, where for two days the university if full
of talks, and stands of open-source projects.

Big projects have a DevRoom, a place reserved for talks related with them. And
here I came... As Strigi is related with KDE me and Jos van Oever will give
two presentations in the KDE DevRoom.

I'll give a talk with the title: _"Strigi desktop integration"_. I'll talk
about the different interfaces you can use for playing with Strigi. These
interfaces are really easy to use, this makes possible to integrate Strigi in
different projects or write some cool front-end without any hassle. Finally
I'll talk about the technologies that reside into Strigi internals. Since
they're really useful, it can be smart to use them in different situations
(also when information retrieval isn't the main goal). Here you can get more
detailed informations about my talk.
