I have some good news about Docker and openSUSE.

First of all the Docker package has been moved from my personal OBS project
to the more official [Virtualization](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?project=Virtualization&package=docker)
one. The next step is to get the Docker package into Factory :)

I'm going to drop the `docker` package from `home:flavio_castelli:docker`,
so make sure to subscribe to the `Virtualization` repository to get latest versions of
Docker.


I have also submitted some openSUSE related documentation to the official Docker
project. If you visit the ["Getting started"](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation)
page you will notice the familiar geeko logo. Click it to be redirected to the
openSUSE's installation instructions.
