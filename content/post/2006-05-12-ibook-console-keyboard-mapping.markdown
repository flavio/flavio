How to have a comfortable italian keyboard layout on your iBook.

### Target

We just want this mapping:

    apple key = alt gr
    numpad return (the key near to left arrow) = canc

### Procedure

Simply download the file at the end of the page and load it using `loadkeys
ibook-it.map.gz`

Simple, isn't it?

### Download
