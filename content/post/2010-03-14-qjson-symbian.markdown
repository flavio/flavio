I'm really pleased to announce that latest version of QJson on master is
working on Symbian. You can find the installation instruction
[here](http://qjson.sourceforge.net/get_it/symbian.html).

Since I'm not a Symbian developer it has been a little hard for me to achieve
that. I would like to thank [Antti Luoma](http://gitorious.org/~anluoma) for
his help.

There are also good news for Windows developers: now building QJson under
Windows is easier. Checkout the new [installation instruction
page](http://qjson.sourceforge.net/get_it/windows.html).

I hope this will help all the Windows developers who want to use QJson.
