Maybe someone has already experimented this situation:

> You're hacking on your local working copy and you want to keep it up-to-date
but, since you have some uncommitted changes, _git-svn rebase_ cannot be
executed

I was just thinking to write something about_ _this problem when I read a
[post](http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/270) on digikam blog.

In this post Marcel proposes a workaround using a bash function. In fact
there's a _"cleaner"_ solution, if you're interested read the last part of my
[git-svn howto](http://www.flavio.castelli.name/howto_use_git_with_svn).
