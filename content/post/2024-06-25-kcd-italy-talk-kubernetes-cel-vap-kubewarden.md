Last week I had the opportunity to speak at [KCD Italy](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-italy-presents-kcd-italy-2024/), a Kubernetes Community Days event.
I delivered a talk titled "How to leverage and extend CEL for your cluster security". The talk gives an overview about
the [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://cel.dev/),
[Kubernetes ValidatingAdmissionPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/),
and [Kubewarden](https://kubewarden.io).

While the talk has been delivered in Italian, the slides are in English and can be found [here](/files/2024/kcd-italy-2024-kubernetes-and-cel.pdf).
