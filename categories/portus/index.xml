      <description>As part of SUSE Hackweek 17 I decided to work on a fully fledged docker registry mirror.
You might wonder why this is needed, after all it&amp;rsquo;s already possible to run a docker distribution (aka registry) instance as a pull-through cache. While that&amp;rsquo;s true, this solution doesn&amp;rsquo;t address the needs of more &amp;ldquo;sophisticated&amp;rdquo; users.
The problem Based on the feedback we got from a lot of SUSE customers it&amp;rsquo;s clear that a simple registry configured to act as a pull-through cache isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description>

      <description>One of the perks of working at SUSE is hackweek, an entire week you can dedicate working on whatever project you want. Last week the 12th edition of hackweek took place. So I decided to spend it working on solving one of the problems many users have when running an on-premise instance of a Docker registry.
The Docker registry works like a charm, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to have full control over the images you push to it.</description>
