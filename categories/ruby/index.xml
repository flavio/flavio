      <description>SUSE Studio is an awesome tool, with a couple of clicks you can create an openSUSE/SUSE based system and deploy to your hard drive, an usb flash, a live dvd, a VMware/VirtualBox/Xen server and even Amazon EC2 cloud.
Suppose you want to create a tailored SUSE Studio appliance to run a Ruby on Rails app, this is a list of things you have to take care of:
 install all the gems required by the app (this can be a long list).</description>

      <description>[](http://flavio.castelli.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/van-halen- jump.jpeg)Let me introduce a small project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on with a friend of mine, Giuseppe Capizzi. The project is called jump and ﻿allows you to quickly change directories in the bash shell using bookmarks.
Thanks to Jump, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to type those long paths anymore.
You can find jump&amp;rsquo;s source code, detailed documentation and installation instructions here.
SUSE packages can be found here.</description>

      <description>This post explains how to execute a single unit test (or even a single test method) instead of running the complete unit test suite.
In order to run the unit tests of your rails application, basically you have these official possibilities:
 rake test: runs all unit, functional and integration tests. rake test:units: runs all the unit tests. rake test:functionals: runs all the functional tests. rake test:integration: runs all the integration tests.</description>

      <description>Also this year I&amp;rsquo;ll attend the Linux day (a day dedicated to Gnu/Linux and FLOSS that occurs every year in Italy) organized by my LUG. Guess what I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about&amp;hellip; ;)
While organizing the event somebody proposed to setup a local server with some music released under CC license. He suggested to download some albums from Jamendo (due to network issues we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to provide direct access to the website).</description>
