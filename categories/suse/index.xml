      <description>One of the perks of working at SUSE is hackweek, an entire week you can dedicate working on whatever project you want. Last week the 12th edition of hackweek took place. So I decided to spend it working on solving one of the problems many users have when running an on-premise instance of a Docker registry.
The Docker registry works like a charm, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to have full control over the images you push to it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce Marcus Sch√§fer has just made possible to build docker images with KIWI.
For those who never heard about it, KIWI is a tool which creates Linux systems for both physical and virtual machines. It can create openSUSE, SUSE and other types of Linux distributions.
Update: I changed the required version of kiwi and the openSUSE 13.1 template. Kiwi just received some improvements which do no longer force the image to include the lxc package.</description>
