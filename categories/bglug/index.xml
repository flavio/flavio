      <description>Last Saturday Linux day 2007 took place.
Linux Day is an Italian manifestation that promotes Linux and FOSS. During this day different organizations (mostly Linux User Groups) arrange events with speeches, installation parties and more.
Since lot of people requested it, I gave a speech about KDE 4 during the Linux day organized by my LUG (BGLug).
The presentation covers the main changes and features introduced by KDE 4. I took inspiration from Troy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Road to KDE 4&amp;rdquo; articles (I like them really much).</description>
