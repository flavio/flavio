      <description>Hackweek 22 took place last week. During this week all the SUSE employees are free to hack on whatever they want. This one of the perks of working at SUSE ðŸ˜Ž.
This time my personal project has been about building a unikernel that runs WebAssembly.
 I wanted this blog post to contain all the details about this journey. However I realized this would have been too much for a single post.</description>
