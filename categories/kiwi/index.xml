      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce Marcus Sch√§fer has just made possible to build docker images with KIWI.
For those who never heard about it, KIWI is a tool which creates Linux systems for both physical and virtual machines. It can create openSUSE, SUSE and other types of Linux distributions.
Update: I changed the required version of kiwi and the openSUSE 13.1 template. Kiwi just received some improvements which do no longer force the image to include the lxc package.</description>
