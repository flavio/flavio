      <title>qjson 0.8.1 released</title>

      <description>Just a quick information, QJson 0.8.1 has been released. This release ensure API and ABI compatibility with version 0.7.1.
The previous 0.8.0 release broke ABI compatibility without changing the SOVERSION.
Toward QJson 1.0.0 I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely happy with some parts of QJson&amp;rsquo;s API. I addressed these issues inside of the 1_0_0 branch.
I would appreciate to hear your opinion before merging this branch into master and releasing QJson 1.0.0.</description>

      <guid>http://flavio.castelli.me/2012/11/21/qjson-0.8.0-released/</guid>
      <description>Almost three years passed since latest release of QJson. A lot of stuff happened in my life and QJson definitely paid for that. I have to admit I&amp;rsquo;m a bit ashamed.
So here we go, QJson 0.8.0 is out!
What changed A lot of bugs has been smashed during this time, this new release will fix issues like this one and this in a nicer way.
QJson&amp;rsquo;s API is still backward compatible, while the ABI changed.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note, I released a new version of the fastuserswitch plasmoid. This new release implements all the improvements suggested by the users plus some minor fixes.
Code can be downloaded from here. openSUSE packages are already available on the build service.
These are some screenshots illustrating fastuserswitch&amp;rsquo;s new features.

      <description>Last week my mother in law started to share her Linux laptop with my wife. Suddenly my wife asked me how she could switch from one user session to another. She was looking for something similar to OS X fast user switch feature but she couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it. In fact there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fast and easy way to switch between users&amp;rsquo; sessions with KDE, until&amp;hellip; now :)
Let me introduce my first plasmoid: the fast user switch plasmoid.</description>

      <description>Some weeks have passed since the announcement of kaveau. I&amp;rsquo;m really proud and happy about this project because I received a lot of positive feedback messages and it has been chosen as one of the best Hackweek&amp;rsquo;s projects.
In the meantime I kept working on kaveau, so let me show you what has changed:
 rdiff-backup has been replaced by rsync. the setup wizard has been improved according to the feedback messages I received.</description>

      <description>During the last week I had the possibility to work on anything I wanted, Novell&amp;rsquo;s hackweek is so cool :)
I decided to dedicate myself to an idea that has been obsessing me since a long time. Last December my brand new hard disk suddenly died, making impossible to recover anything. Fortunately I had just synchronized the most important documents between my workstation and my laptop, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose anything important.</description>

      <description>Gran Canaria Desktop Summit has been great and really productive. I had the pleasure to meet people interested in QJson, chat with them but also hack with them.
In fact we hacked a lot, doing lots of changes to QJson:
 the API has been cleaned, now it can be considered stable unicode support has been completely rewritten it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to convert QVariant objects into JSON ones   So it&amp;rsquo;s with a great pleasure that I announce the release of QJson 0.</description>

On Thursday 9th July I&amp;rsquo;ll give a BoF about QJson.
During the talk I will show:
 the advantages brought by QJson. the usage of QJson. some real programs using QJson.  See you soon!</description>

      <description>During the last weekend I hacked a bit on rockmarble and I added a new feature: retrieve all the events happening in a certain city.
As usual data is provided by last.fm, which should return also the events _&amp;ldquo;near&amp;rdquo; _the specified city (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me to define a value for near :) ).
I have created new openSUSE packages, this time everything should work fine. Just make sure to remove all qjson packages before installing this release (in fact all the previous problems were due to packaging errors of qjson, now I have created new packages called libqjson0).</description>

      <description>During the last weekend I wanted to have some fun with QJson. So I came out with this idea: retrieve from last.fm the tour dates of my favourite artists and display the locations using Marble.
After some hacking I created this small application: rockmarble&amp;hellip;
If you have a last.fm account rockmarble will import your favourite artist list. Otherwise you can add one artists at a time.
The tour location will be displayed inside Marble, using openstreetmap.</description>

      <description>Yes, long time has passed since my last post (really strange, isn&amp;rsquo;t it :D ). It has been a busy period, full of work, dog training and&amp;hellip; coding (fortunately!).
During this time I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on XesamQLib creation. This is a Qt based library for accessing Xesam services. Its API is going to be similar to Xesam-glib one and it will make life easier for developers who want to interact with programs exposing Xesam service (who talked about Strigi?</description>

 KDE integration: Flavio will coordinate the definition of interfaces over which KDE will handle searching and metadata. He can ask Aaron, Evgeny and Jos for help with the interface design. The interface will cover:</description>

      <description>As you may know, KDE4 will use Strigi for meta information extraction instead of the old KFilePlugin classes.
Since Strigi&amp;rsquo;s analyzer work in a different way, lot of code has to be ported. Unfortunately, after a good start, some relevant analyzers were still missing.
But in the last weeks Strigi gained support of:
 wave file avi files txt files dds files rgb files sid files ico files  I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated this summary page.</description>

      <description>Last Monday I submitted lot of changes into Strigi&amp;rsquo;s trunk. I&amp;rsquo;ve heavily refactored some classes in order to obtain a more flexible file system notification infrastructure. Thanks to this work now it will be easier to add support for new file system notification facilities. For example, in order to add File Alteration Monitor (aka FAM) support I had to write only 576 loc (including license and documentation stuff).
So, by now, Strigi supports the following file system monitoring facilities:</description>

      <description>Maybe someone has already experimented this situation:
 You&amp;rsquo;re hacking on your local working copy and you want to keep it up-to-date but, since you have some uncommitted changes, git-svn rebase cannot be executed
 I was just thinking to write something about_ _this problem when I read a post on digikam blog.
In this post Marcel proposes a workaround using a bash function. In fact there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;cleaner&amp;rdquo; solution, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested read the last part of my git-svn howto.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday Linux day 2007 took place.
Linux Day is an Italian manifestation that promotes Linux and FOSS. During this day different organizations (mostly Linux User Groups) arrange events with speeches, installation parties and more.
Since lot of people requested it, I gave a speech about KDE 4 during the Linux day organized by my LUG (BGLug).
The presentation covers the main changes and features introduced by KDE 4. I took inspiration from Troy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Road to KDE 4&amp;rdquo; articles (I like them really much).</description>

      <description>In these days I&amp;rsquo;ve heard lot of rumors around Git. After reading some manual/tutorial/guide I discovered that it can be really useful, especially if you spend lot of time coding off-line (that&amp;rsquo;s my situation).
This is a really small howto that describes how to work on a project versioned with svn (maybe taken from KDE repository ;) ) using git.
What&amp;rsquo;re the advantages? Since Git is a distributed revision control system (while svn is a centralized one) you can perform commits, brances, merges,&amp;hellip; on your local working dir without being connected to internet.</description>

      <description>As I said in this previous post, Strigi&amp;rsquo;s Xesam support was half-done since XesamUserSearchLanguage wasn’t yet handled. Well, this is no longer true&amp;hellip; ;) In these weeks I’ve been working on XesamUserSearchLanguage support. Ehm&amp;hellip; to be honest, I’ve been fighting with Bison.
But in the end I tamed the beast and now Xesam support in Strigi is full.
IMHO XesamUserSearchLanguage can be considered more important than XesamQueryLanguage since common users will write queries in this way.</description>

She closed the main water tap and I took the first train for home (yes, since I&amp;rsquo;m an outlier I take the train two times per day). Once arrived at home I performed some hacking on the guilty washing machine, checked some pipes and than took the next train for office.</description>

Actually the only way to perform XesamQueryLanguage queries with Strigi is through the strigicmd program.
Strigicmd is a command-line tool shipped with Strigi. It can perform different actions like:</description>

      <description>Since last Thursday Strigi gained XesamQueryLanguage support. This means that now is possible to process queries formulated using this syntax.
But why is this important? If you aren&amp;rsquo;t able to answer the previous question probably you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is Xesam. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short definition taken from the official site: Xesam is an umbrella project with the purpose of providing unified apis and specs for desktop search- and metadata services.</description>

      <description>Some days ago I committed lots of changes regarding inotify support. Goodies and improvements have been introduced&amp;hellip; I had this code laying on my laptop for several weeks because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to fully test it. An annoying bug afflicting the update index operations was blocking me. But some days ago Jos fixed it, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any excuse :)
These are the major changes introduced:
 event caching: using a small cache it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to simplify multiple events and prevent high cpu usage when lot of changes occur on the same files interruption handling during the re-index operations: changing the directories to watch during an indexing operation will break the previous job and start a new one other small changes for improving cpu utilization   Actually I&amp;rsquo;m very happy of the first point, but I think the second one can still be improved&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have to admit that lately I have a really bad habit: I forget to commit my changes to Strigi. In this way I end-up performing multiple commits with different changes inside: from stupid to interesting one. This is a really bad behavior, so today I decided to perform some svn status and svn diff and I made some commits on Strigi trunk. Most of all are just code readability improvement == don&amp;rsquo;t exceed the 80 chars per line.</description>

      <description>A small resume of my FOSDEM experience&amp;hellip;
Friday evening Departure from Italy. The plane landed in Charlesroi airport, where we (me and Laura) take a bus for Bruxelles. Once in the city it was so late that there was no public transport, so we had to take a cab in order to reach our hotel.
Saturday Small tour in Bruxelles. As we thought Bruxelles is a beautiful city with lot of things to see, in fact there are too many things to see for a 2 day trip!</description>

      <title>Strigi Desktop integration</title>

      <description>Short abstract: Strigi desktop integration: how to access Strigi features.
Strigi, the fastest and smallest desktop search engine, provides fast searches and good metadata extraction capabilities. It will be used by the next KDE, but it can be easily integrated in other programs.
Long abstract: Modern humans are using more and more data every day. Keeping data organized is becoming insufficient, so finding and filtering documents have become key tasks in modern operating systems.</description>

      <description>Last night I spent a couple of hours adding a missing feature to klaptopdaemon. Are you curious? keep reading&amp;hellip; Yesterday I installed a new kde icon theme. It looked really nice but there was a problem: klaptopdaemon tray icon didn&amp;rsquo;t work. In fact the icon didn&amp;rsquo;t show the battery level, it was always at 0%. Quite annoying isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Since I liked the theme I decided to add a new option to klaptopdaemon: print the battery level percentage over the systray icon.</description>
