## Foreword

Here you can find a small core dump of my life (if you're not a developer call it short summary).  Since keeping this page updated has a low priority in my life, the following content may lack something.  

## About me

I was born on 12th July 1982 in [Bergamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamo,_Italy) (a city in the north of Italy near Milan) where I still live.  
Currently I work as a software developer for SUSE linux. You can see my resume
[here](/cv).

I'm Linux lover, a member of the [KDE e.V.](http://ev.kde.org/) and a
[KDE](http://kde.org/) developer. I'm the vice-president of
[BgLUG](http://bglug.it/), the Linux User Group of my hometown.

You can find some of my code on [gitorious](http://gitorious.org/~flavio),
[github](http://github.com/flavio/),
[sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/users/flavio_castelli), on this blog and
on KDE's repositories.

If you want you can follow me on

## What I like to do when I'm not in front of something using binary code

I love to spend time with my lovely wife Laura. my daughters Elena and Alessia,
my awesome dachshund and my tortoise.

I like to read books (I love Isaac Asimov's ones and I'm a **big** fan of the
[Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/)), listen to music, watch movies, hang
out with my friends and travel.

I also play some sports like swimming, running and maybe one day I'll start
playing tennis again.

I constantly try to  learn the art of bonsai trees. Checkout the website of my
[bonsai club](http://clubmondobonsai.it/) (guess who made it ;) ).
