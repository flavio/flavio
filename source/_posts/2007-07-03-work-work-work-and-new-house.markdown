In my last message I promised to write some more contents on this site, in
order to keep it more updated. As usual I disappointed this promise :)  So,
what I have been doing in these day? Just a simple answer: I've worked a lot.
"Work" can be divided in the following categories:

  * office work
  * KDE & Strigi coding
  * Physical work
  
The most important of all is the last one. I've spent all my week-ends working
in my **new house**. I've been fixing and improving it (wow... it seems I'm
talking about a piece of software ;) ) and now it's quite finished.

I've to say a great _"thank you"_ to my dad. He's able to do everything (he's
something better than [Mac Gyver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver)) and
helped me a lot (in fact he has done all the dirty jobs).

Prepare yourself, I'll put some photos of the house really soon...
