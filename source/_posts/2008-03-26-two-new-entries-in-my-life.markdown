Last week two new entries entered my life.A shiny brand-newÂ _Macbook pro
_arrived on Thursday. I've always dreamed of one of this wonderful laptops
(I've been an happy iBook user for a long time). Two weeks ago I finally
surrendered (I've always been scared of the high price) and I've ordered this
new _toy_. Now, after one week of usage I'm really happy about it.

Currently I'm using Linux as primary Os, but I'll give a try also to KDE4 on
Mac ;)

The other new entry is _Baguette_, a three-months old dachshund. She's really
lovely, running around the house eating random things like shoes (I think it's
a must for all pets) and usb cables (she's already a geek-dog).

I think I'll have to keep an eye on Baguette, otherwise I'll find another bite
on my Macbook pro apple ;)
