Last Saturday _Linux day 2007_ took place.

_Linux Day_ is an Italian manifestation that promotes Linux and FOSS. During
this day different organizations (mostly [Linux User
Groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_User_Group)) arrange events with
speeches, installation parties and more.

Since lot of people requested it, I gave a speech about KDE 4 during the
_Linux day_ organized by my LUG ([BGLug](http://www.bglug.it)).

The presentation covers the main changes and features introduced by KDE 4. I
took inspiration from Troy's _"Road to KDE 4"_ articles (I like them really
much).

People liked the speech and, most important of all, showed great interest for
KDE 4.
