Just a quick information, QJson 0.8.1 has been released. This release ensure API and ABI compatibility with version 0.7.1.

The previous 0.8.0 release broke ABI compatibility without changing the `SOVERSION`.

## Toward QJson 1.0.0

I'm not entirely happy with some parts of QJson's API. I addressed these issues inside of the [1_0_0](https://github.com/flavio/qjson/tree/1_0_0) branch.

I would appreciate to hear your opinion before merging this branch into master and releasing QJson 1.0.0.
