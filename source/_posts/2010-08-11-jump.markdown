[](http://flavio.castelli.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/van-halen-
jump.jpeg)Let me introduce a small project I've been working on with a friend
of mine, [Giuseppe Capizzi](http://twitter.com/gcapizzi). The project is
called **jump** and ﻿allows you to quickly change directories in the bash
shell using bookmarks.

Thanks to Jump, you won't have to type those long paths anymore.
