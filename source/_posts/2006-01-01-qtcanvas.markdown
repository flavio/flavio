Finally qtcanvas classes are available for Qt 4 series

This isn't the final version of qtcanvas, it's only a backport of the original
classes shipped with Qt3.

So what's the difference between this qtcanvas and qt3canvas (available only
through Qt3 support with Qt4)? Simple this version works with all open-source
versions of Qt >= 4.1.0!!

In this way you can use qtcanvas also under windows (before it wasn't possible
with the open-source edition).

I've tried qtcanvas under Mac OS X Tiger, Gnu-Linux and Windows XP and they
work fine.
