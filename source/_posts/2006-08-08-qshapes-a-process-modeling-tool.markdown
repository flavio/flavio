A lot of time passed since my last post. As usually I've been too busy to keep
the site updated, forgive me! Last time I let fall something about one of my
university projects: qshapes.  Now it's time to tell you something more...
QShapes is a process modeling tool, in short words a kind of 2D CAD.

I'm going to release it under GPL over berlios site. Actually I I've
registered the project (see http://developer.berlios.de/projects/qshapes/ ),
committed some code on the svn repository and uploaded some screenshot). The
program is "quite" stable (there're yet some crashes) and can run under linux,
macos and windows. It's written in C++ using Qt for the gui so it's really
portable. I think I'll use this program as a starting point for one of my
dreams: a multiplatform open-source diagram creation tool like dia, kivio or
Microsoft visioÂ®. I like dia and kivio but both lacks of some components /
features. Since I don't like too much "gnomish" software I'll never improve
dia. On the other hand kivio is quite pretty but poor than dia in some
situations. Especially kivio isn't multiplatform and this's a great problem
for a me.

But now I'm really busy so I'll start working on this project after my second
level thesis (I'll tell you something about it really soon).
