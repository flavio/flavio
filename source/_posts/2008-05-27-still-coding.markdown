Yes, long time has passed since my last post (really strange, isn't it :D ).
It has been a busy period, full of work, dog training and... coding
(fortunately!).

During this time I've been working on XesamQLib creation. This is a Qt based
library for accessing [Xesam](http://www.xesam.org/main) services. Its API is
going to be similar to [Xesam-glib](http://xesam.org/people/kamstrup/xesam-
glib/) one and it will make life easier for developers who want to interact
with programs exposing Xesam service (who talked about _Strigi_? :D )

Right now I'm finishing to clean the code, in order to publish a first version
of XesamQLib on KDE repository. I'll keep you updated.
