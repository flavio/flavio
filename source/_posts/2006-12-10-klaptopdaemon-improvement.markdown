Last night I spent a couple of hours adding a missing feature to
klaptopdaemon. Are you curious? keep reading...  Yesterday I installed a new
kde icon theme. It looked really nice but there was a problem: klaptopdaemon
tray icon didn't work. In fact the icon didn't show the battery level, it was
always at 0%. Quite annoying isn't it? Since I liked the theme I decided to
add a new option to klaptopdaemon: print the battery level percentage over the
systray icon.

I've just contacted klaptopdaemon maintainers and I'm going to commit it into
kde svn, so you'll get everything into next klaptopdaemon release :)
