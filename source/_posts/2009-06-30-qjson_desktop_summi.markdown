Now that I have booked both the flights and the hotel it's official: I'll
attend the [Gran Canaria Desktop Summit](http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/).

On Thursday 9th July I'll give a BoF about
[QJson](http://qjson.sourceforge.net).

During the talk I will show:

  * the advantages brought by QJson.
  * the usage of QJson.
  * some real programs using QJson.

See you soon!
