I have to admit that lately I have a really bad habit: I forget to commit my
changes to Strigi. In this way I end-up performing multiple commits with
different changes inside: from stupid to interesting one.  This is a really
bad behavior, so today I decided to perform some `svn status` and `svn diff`
and I made some commits on Strigi trunk. Most of all are just code readability
improvement == don't exceed the 80 chars per line.

I think that Jos will be really happy to see them ;)
