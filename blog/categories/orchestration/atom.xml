    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago the 11th edition of SUSE&rsquo;s <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">hackweek</a>
took place. This year I decided to spend this time to look into the different
orchestration and service discovery tools build around Docker.</p>

<p>In the beginning I looked into the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes">kubernetes</a>
project. I found it really promising but AFAIK not yet ready to be used. It&rsquo;s
still in its early days and it&rsquo;s in constant evolution. I will surely keep
looking into it.</p>

<p>I also looked into other projects like <a href="https://consul.io/">consul</a> and
<a href="http://openshift.github.io/geard/">geard</a> but then I focused on using
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/fleet">fleet</a>, two of the tools part of
<a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a>.</p>

<p>I ended up creating a small testing environment that is capable of running a
simple guestbook web application talking with a MongoDB database. Both the web
application and the database are shipped as Docker images running on a small
cluster.</p>

<p>The whole environment is created by <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. That
project proved to be also a nice excuse to play with this tool. I found Vagrant
to be really useful.</p>

<p>You can find all the files and instructions required to reproduce my experiments
inside of <a href="https://github.com/flavio/docker-orchestration-demo">this</a> repository
on GitHub.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
